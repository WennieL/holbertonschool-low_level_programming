<br> C - malloc, free <br> <br> 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee <br>Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char. <br> Prototype: char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c); <br> Returns NULL if size = 0 <br> Returns a pointer to the array, or NULL if it fails <br>
<br> 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings <br> Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. <br> 
<br>Prototype: char *_strdup(char *str); <br>The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.<br>Returns NULL if str = NULL<br>On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available <br> <br> 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life <br> Write a function that concatenates two strings.<br>Prototype: char *str_concat(char *s1, char *s2);<br>The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated<br>if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string<br>The function should return NULL on failure<br>
