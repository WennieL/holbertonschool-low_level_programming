<br> C - Structures, typedef <br> <br> 0. Poppy <br> Define a new type struct dog with the following elements:<br> name, type = char *<br> age, type = float <br> owner, type = char *<br> 
<br> 1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself <br> < br> Write a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog <br> Prototype: void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner); <br> <br> 2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad <br> <br> Write a function that prints a struct dog <br> Prototype: void print_dog(struct dog *d);<br>Format: see example bellow<br>You are allowed to use the standard library<br>If an element of d is NULL, print (nil) instead of this element. (if name is NULL, print Name: (nil))<br>If d is NULL print nothing.<br>
